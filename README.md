### Rounded Window Corners Extension

If you are using GNOME, it is recommended you install the [Rounded Window Corners](https://github.com/yilozt/rounded-window-corners) extension.

This theme includes a configuration for this extension to make GTK3 apps look closer to Libadwaita apps.

## Downloading and Installing

#### First, download the repository.

If storage space / network usage is not a problem, run this:
```
git clone https://github.com/dgsasha/qualia-gtk-theme -b main && cd qualia-gtk-theme
```
If you want to limit the download size and don't plan on contributing, run this instead:
```
git clone --depth=1 --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules https://github.com/dgsasha/qualia-gtk-theme -b main && cd qualia-gtk-theme
```

#### Next, run the install script to configure and install the theme.

When configuring the theme you get to choose the install dir and [accent color](#available-accent-colors), choose the theme variant, and choose which themes you want to install.

If you are going to install the Firefox theme, read [this](https://github.com/dgsasha/qualia-gtk-theme/wiki/Firefox-Theme) first, and if you are going to install the VS Code theme, read [this](https://github.com/dgsasha/qualia-gtk-theme/wiki/VS-Code-Theme) first.

```
./install.py
```

</div>

```
usage: install.py [-h] [-c] [-r] [-d] [-t] [-w] [-s] [-F] [-a] [-f] [-n] [-v]

This script is used to install, update, and reconfigure the theme

options:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -c, --clean        clean build directories and exit
  -r, --reconfigure  reconfigure the theme
  -d, --install-dir  change install dir
  -t, --theme        change theme variant
  -w, --window       change window controls variant
  -s, --syntax       change VS Code syntax highlighting
  -F, --firefox      change Firefox settings theming
  -a, --accent       change accent color
  -f, --force        force install the theme
  -n, --no-update    don't update the submodules, useful if you made local changes
  -v, --verbose      verbose mode
```

<div align="center">

#### Available Accent Colors:
![Accent Colors](.github/images/accents-dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)
![Accent Colors](.github/images/accents-light.svg#gh-light-mode-only)

## Updating

You should try to update the theme frequently, and always make sure it is up to date before opening issues.

To update, pull in changes from the git repo and run the install script again.

```
git pull
```
```
./install.py
```

Only the themes that have updates will be reinstalled, if you want to force reinstall everything, use the `--force` option.

Your previous configuration will be used again unless you use the `--reconfigure` option.

There are other options to change parts of the configuration, all of them are listed above in the [Downloading and Installing](#downloading-and-installing) section.

If for some reason the update fails, try running `./install.py -c` and then run the install script again before you open an issue. This cleans the build directories, and often has to be done when there are major changes.

#### Warning about GNOME

</summary>

The GNOME Shell often changes a lot between major releases. For this reason you will always need to run `./install.py` after updating GNOME to make sure the latest version of the theme is installed. You should probably do this for other desktops as well, just in case there are changes.

You should also probably avoid using alpha builds of GNOME because I might not have the theme updated to support them yet.

</details>

## Uninstalling

Run the uninstall script followed by any number of the below themes to choose what to uninstall.

Or run the uninstall script with no arguments to uninstall the entire theme.

```
./uninstall.py
```

</div>

```
Usage:
    ./uninstall.py <option> <theme> ...

Themes:
    gtk3            gtk4-libadwaita  gnome-shell
    cinnamon-shell  metacity         unity
    xfwm4           firefox          icons
    cursors         sounds           gtksourceview
    snap            vscode           gtk4-config

Options:
    -v, --verbose   Verbose mode.
    -d, --dry-run   Similar to verbose mode, except nothing is actually deleted.
    -h, --help      Show this screen.
```
